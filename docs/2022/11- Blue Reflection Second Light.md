Date of Starting: 2022/02/09
Date of Finishing: 2022/06/30
- Positive Points
    - Improved a lot the game in terms of Gameplay
    - The maps are differents and visually stunding
    - It has less fanservice than the first game.
    - Ao is relatable.
    - 
    - Battles 1by1 are nice addition
        - * But It's needed some timing polish
- Negative Points
    - Missing combined attacks like BR1 (Precure-style)
    - There is a only track for regular battle for half game (VS 2-3 first game)
    - Because ATB, The attack animations are less focused.
    - It doesn't have memorable moments like "...Okay, I'm never becoming a Software Engineer"
    - It's so long, a simple run is just 50 Hours which for enjoy completly you need make a New Game+ for see maximum bonds/SocialLinks endings and the True ending (100Hours...)
- Neutral Points
    - You could say MobilePhone had some downgrade comprated to BR1 but I understand this is for focusing in the plot.
    - You could say Hinako is more sarcastic on the first BR
