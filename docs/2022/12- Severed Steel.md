- Postive Points
    - It's Mirror's Edge (Parkour) + Hotline Miami (Fast Paced) + Doom (Fastpaced shooter) + SuperHot (Slowdown mode)+ Metroid Prime (Because the cannon)
    - Environment destrucction (via Voxels)
- Neutral
    - It's "short" (5 Hours)
        - For me, It's great because I need short games between larges one but I understand price/hours is not that good. (~20€)
        - I got it from Humble Heroines Bundle Tier 3 (17.83€)
- Negative Points
    - Mirror's Edge-like Narrative (Video Comic Cinematic abstract)
