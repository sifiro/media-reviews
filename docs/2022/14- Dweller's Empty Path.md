# Dweller's Empty Path

Date of Starting: 2022/07/05  
Date of Finishing: 2022/07/05

- Postive Points
  - Fashion Store Scene
      - The part when they are parodying a Final-Fantasy Classic JRPG
          (But It's not from the main protagonist prespective)
  - World Building
  - Cool Animations for a "PWYW" Game
- Neutral Points
  - It's Short
- Negative Points
  - Too much backtracking
  - It's not intuitive where to go for a lot of scenes.
    - (I understand it's some kind of exploration game, but The Map is so big and the character too slow even with the always running)
