I didn't watch back in the day because I was saturated with too monster girl's animes watched, I expected to be just one of the bunch.
(Spoiler: I was wrong.) because of the popularity of the series nowadays being a Best-seller and some moots watched it.

I am not interested in horse racing (or any kind of sports anime) but still not bad I would prefer more idol theme than horse racing.

Some weeks ago, I read a graph (on Reddit or Twitter or somewhere, IDK, I didn't find the source) about what adaptation is more idol-ish or more sports.

I read that season one is more about idols than sports and am kinda disappointed. I understand the franchise is about two concepts (horse racing and idol) which are time-consuming for an Anime of 13 episodes. there isn't enough space for all.

- Positive Points
    - I didn't expect the Spe backstory
    - I mean, It's nothing new, however, It's better than just "I wanna be a horse racing/idol"
    - Said that the personality is very Haruka (iM@S)
      - I like the relationship between Spe and Silent.
- Negative Points
    - I expected more idol stuff than horse racing
    - The Trainer is a big red flag as a house. (I mean, watch the beginning episode one)
    - Neutral Points
    - WTH is wrong with Gold Ship
- Fun Stuff
    - The Names
        - Spe reminds me for Espe (diminutive of Esperanza, Hope) xd
        - "El Condor Pasa" reminds Condorito for some reason.
            - Despite I only know about him because of some videos from a Chilean Youtuber, I didn't read any book.
