## Short Opinion

It's like Durarara but with furries, It's quite enjoyable, but the plotwist ending feels like a cheat but It doesn't affect the development of main plot.  

Maybe It has a bit of boomer humor. (But I can understand because these characters are oldies)

- Positive Points:
  - Main Plot makes you interested
  - Epsiode 2's: love declaration is quite cute.
- Negative Points:
  - Maybe the Episode 3 is quite depressive  
        and the character arc of that character is some how
            "If you are a looser, you're a looser forever"
  - The end of main character arc is kind werid

A lot of people said about this anime be the AOTY but I don't find anything impressive about it. It's enjoyable and makes you interested about the plot.
