# Sono Bisque Doll wa Koi o Suru (Anime Cosplay)

## Short Opinion

I feel sad about the ecchi scenes because somehow they feels cut the rhythm of the scenes. (hopefully, there are only one or two scenes by chapter) despite her author love them.

This Anime has wonderful moments, Marin herself and her cosplay or anime passion is just lovely, the feelings of Envy of Sajuna (because Marin cosplay) feels so human,
Overall the Sajuna & Shinju Initial arc is just well-done (imo)

And somehow, I feel bad seeing how a lot of fanarts of Marin are only fanservice when the character isn't just that. With others characters (In General) I wouldn't care.
But this time not (And that, It's WEIRD).

When I saw to Wakana in the first chapters It was so annoying with his nervousness
(I wouldn't say is nonsensical but for me It's just annoying) but the character develop his personality (or I just get used to his character, idk) and It's not just the character with one/same joke.

Overall: I can't recommend this Anime because no-everyone can deal with the fanservice and the people which can deal with the fanservice, a big porcent It just look for the fanservice.

It's frustring
