# Princess Connect

## Season 1

### Short Opinion

- Positive Points:
  - Double Agent Trope ("TokenEvilTeammate")
    - I mean, It's not a original thing but I like some personal conflicts and make somehow more interesting the plot.
    - ~~Despite It doesn't make any difference ~~~  Season 2: Make stuff working.
      - UPDATE: HOLY COW, SEASON 2 IS DOING A LOT OF STUFF
  - Main Female Cast Fighter
    - Despite sometimes Yuuki have to much focus for be "Support" character.
      - And I don't have problem if A Support character has protagonism, the issue is when is just because is a ~~man~~ typical projection character peronalitless
- Negative Points:
  - Early Episode 1 is so Yuuki-focused (That was my initial dropping)
  - Kokkoro fall in the [Empty Nest](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmptyNest "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmptyNest") & [Undying Loyalty](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndyingLoyalty "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndyingLoyalty") tropes
  - I almost forgot about the

## Season 2

### Short Opinion (Season 2)

- Positive Points
  - Takes the TokenEvilTeammate more seriously
    - OH, HOLY COW.
  - Episode 4: I find lovely the interaction with the humanoid shadow.
- Negative Points
  - I would say None

## Overall Opinion (Season 2)

I can say I enjoy watching, It has some geniune lovely moments, maybe the "Token Evil Teammate" is not a original trope but I really like how is done.
(probably because a long time ago, I don't watch something of this kind of conflict.)
It's not a impressive show but It's one recommendable... Just if Kokoro wasn't a Empty Nest. (outside of that, Lovely)
